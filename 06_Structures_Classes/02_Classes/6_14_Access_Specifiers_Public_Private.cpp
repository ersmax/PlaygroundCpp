// Explain what public: and private: mean in a class definition.

// Private members (member function or member variable) can only
// be accessed in the definition of a member function of the class
// which they belong to.
// Public members can be accessed anywhere.

// Formally:
//    All members(member variables and member functions) that are marked private:
// can only be accessed by name in the definitions of member functions(both public
// and private) of the same class.Members marked public: have no restrictions on
// where they can be used.
