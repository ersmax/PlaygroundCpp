//b.How many private: sections are required in a class ?

// a. At least one public section
// b. None required, but at least one recommended for class member variables 
// Formally:
// a.Only one.The compiler warns if you have no public: members in a class (or
//	 struct, for that matter).
// b.None, but we normally expect to find at least one private: section in a class.
