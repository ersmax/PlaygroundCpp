/*
Suppose a dynamic variable were created as follows:
char *p;
p = new char;
Assuming that the value of the pointer variable p has not changed (so it still
points to the same dynamic variable), how can you destroy this new dynamic
variable and return the memory it uses to the freestore manager so that the
memory can be reused to create other new dynamic variables?
