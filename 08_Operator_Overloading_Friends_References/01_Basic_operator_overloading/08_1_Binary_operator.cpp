// What is the difference between a(binary) operator and a function ?


// A binary operator is a function where operands are before and after the operator. 

// Formally:
//   The difference between a (binary) operator (such as + , *, or /) and a function
// involves the syntax of how they are called.In a function call, the arguments are
// given in parentheses after the function name.With an operator the arguments are
// given before and after the operator. Also, you must use the reserved word operator
// in the operator declaration and in the definition of an overloaded operator.
